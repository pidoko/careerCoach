It was good that you addressed the issue directly with the concerned individual initially, which shows respect and a willingness to understand your team member's point of view. However, to strengthen your response, consider including the impact of your actions. For instance, discuss any positive changes in team behavior or improvements in project outcomes post-intervention. Additionally, mentioning your follow-up actions to ensure compliance beyond just the training could demonstrate a more robust commitment to ethical practices. Finally, reflecting on what you learned from this experience and how it has shaped your decision-making in future situations would provide deeper insight into your development as a leader."}
{"question": "Can you describe a time when you faced an ethical dilemma at work or school and how you handled it?", "response": "Certainly. While in my graduate program at Northeastern University Vancouver, I was working on a group project where we had to complete a software solution for a class assignment. I found out that some of my group members were considering using parts of a code available online that matched our project requirements but wasn\u2019t allowed per the university\u2019s policy on plagiarism. I faced an ethical dilemma where I had to choose between confronting my peers or ignoring the situation. I decided to discuss the issue with the group, emphasizing the importance of originality and ethics in our academic work. I suggested alternatives and offered to help anyone struggling with the assignment. Fortunately, they agreed and we completed the project independently. I learned that addressing such issues openly and constructively can lead to positive outcomes and maintain integrity within the team.", "feedback": "Your response effectively demonstrates a good example of handling an ethical issue, highlighting your moral standards and leadership capabilities. To strengthen your answer, consider providing more detail about the specific actions you took to help your peers avoid ethical pitfalls, such as any specific resources you provided or educational discussions you initiated. Also, mentioning any reflections or lessons learned from the professors or supervisors involved would add depth, showing your willingness to engage with authority figures for guidance. It would also be beneficial to briefly mention the outcome following the project submission, like peer feedback or grades, to give a clearer picture of the impact of your actions."}
