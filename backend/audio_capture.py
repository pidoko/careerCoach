    Callback function triggered by the sounddevice library when audio data is received from the microphone.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    indata : numpy.ndarray
        A NumPy array containing the incoming audio data for the current buffer.
    frames : int
        The number of frames in the audio buffer.
    time : CData
        Time information provided by the audio stream (start time, current time, etc.).
    status : sounddevice.CallbackFlags
        Status flag indicating if any underruns or overruns occurred during recording.

    Notes:
    ------
    This function appends the captured audio data to a global recording buffer if recording is active.

    Starts continuous audio recording on a background thread.

    This function initializes a new recording session by:
    - Checking if a recording is already in progress.
    - Creating a new background thread to capture audio.
    - Using a sounddevice InputStream to continuously capture audio data.
    - Appending incoming audio data to a global recording buffer (for later processing or saving).

    Global Variables:
    -----------------
    recording_thread : threading.Thread
        Thread responsible for capturing audio.
    recording_active : bool
        Flag to control the recording loop.
    recording_buffer : list
        List used to store incoming audio data chunks.

    Notes:
    ------
    - This function supports continuous recording until `recording_active` is set to False.
    - Audio data is collected using the `audio_callback` function, which must be defined elsewhere.
    - Recording happens in 16-bit integer format (`int16`) and mono (`channels=1`).

    Stops the active audio recording session and saves the recorded audio to a WAV file.

    This function:
    - Stops the background recording thread.
    - Concatenates all collected audio buffers into a single array.
    - Ensures the output directory exists if a path is provided.
    - Writes the final audio data to the specified WAV file.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    filename : str, optional
        The name (or full path) of the output WAV file. Defaults to 'output.wav'.

    Returns:
    --------
    str or None
        The filename if recording data was saved successfully, or None if no data was recorded.

    Global Variables:
    -----------------
    recording_active : bool
        Flag that controls the recording loop.
    recording_thread : threading.Thread
        The background thread responsible for audio capture.
    recording_buffer : list
        List storing the audio data buffers collected during the session.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If no data was recorded (e.g., the recording was started and stopped too quickly), no file is written.
    - The recording buffer is expected to contain arrays of consistent shape (mono channel).
